    "## 1. Introduction <a class='anchor' id='introduction'></a>\n",
    "It happens all too often. Coworkers and friends asking, \"Hey, didn't you write some code that does XYZ? Where can I find that?\" or \"I'm working on something that you mentioned having done before. Can I see your code?\" I figured having my own <a href='https://www.nigelstorydata.com'>website</a> to which I could direct them would save me a little time, but then the followup questions start: \"Which project is it in? Where is that on your site?\" And things are made worse when even I can't remember.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "I needed a search bar. Not a run-of-the-mill keyword lookup, I needed something that could search through my write-ups and code: something where I could search \"Poisson simulation\" or \"dbscan clustering\" and get good results. With a simple keyword search, it would be impossible to anicipate what a person might want to look for, so in this project we will be implementing a searching and ranking algorithm based in NLP that can give us results for any relevant query that a user might search."

    "### 1.1 Methods <a class='anchor' id='methods'></a>\n",
    "To acheive a more robust search experience, we will combine fuzzy keyword matching techniques with text vectorization and cosine similarity. Specifically, we will start by reading and preprocessing HTML documents created from my own Jupyter Notebook projects that appear on <a href='https://www.nigelstorydata.com' target='_blank'>nigelstorydata.com</a>, then we will create a Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer to convert each document and users' search queries to vector representations. We will then use the cosine similarity between each document and search query as the first component of our results ranking. <br><br>\n",
    "Next, we will create a three tiered tagging system for our documents, and the tags that we assign will contribute to keyword matching scores: one for title matching, one for category matching, and one for miscellaneous tags. The matching between search terms and tags will be fuzzy, or intentionally imprecise, by matching based on the Levenshtein Distance Ratio between the search terms and each tag, and it is this ratio that contributes to the total search rank score.<br><br>\n",
    "The scores are combined as follows: $Search Rank Score = Title Match Score + 0.3*CategoryMatchScore + 0.5*TagMatchScore + CosineSimilarity$\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "This search algorithm is currently deployed on the website. Search queries are sent via POST request to the site server asynchronously, and the data processing and responses are handled via CGI."

We'll also be using the _nltk_ library to accomplish NLP preprocessing tasks and _Beautiful Soup_ to extract our text data from the Jupyter notebooks.

Using the Levenshtein ratio will remedy these kinds of small differences.<br><br>\n",

    "In production, the algorithm works exactly the same way it does here; there's just the added hurdles of how to pass data between an HTML/PHP/JavaScript website and Python.<br><br>\n",
    "Python has many libraries to facilitate this kind of data pipeline, like Falsk or Django, but the quickest and easiest solution is by using CGI, or the common gateway interface. Enabling CGI on a webserver allows for programming languages like Perl or Python to respond to GET and POST requests and pass data to front-end web applications.<br><br>\n",
    "When a user submits a search on the website, a POST request is sent asynchronously via ajax to the CGI Python script. This script loads in a pretrained TF-IDF model, preprocesses the search text, calculates the search rank score, and finally returns results. In production, the results of a search are returned as templated HTML snippets that can be displayed directly on the site and viewed by the front-end user."

    "I get a huge amount of satisfaction when data science can be used in a visible way, and it doesn't get much more visible than this. Using TF-IDF combined with fuzzy matching on keywords produces strong results, and though I believe some additional tweaking may be required before it's perfect, I am well pleased with these results so far.<br><br>\n",
    "This algorithm can be improved in the short-term in two ways: 1. find an optimal balance of the weights used in the calculation of the search rank score, and 2. add a more rich set of tags to augment search results.<br><br>\n",
